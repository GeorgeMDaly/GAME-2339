# Final Thoughts

gravity very strong, makes jumping feel useless half the time
check points need better indicators,would ocasionly die and get sent waaaaaaay back
web player crashed on me once after finishing a level,no idea if an issue with game or my hardware
would be nice to have an indicator for the hint locations so i know where to stand to read them
overall its not a bad game the core mechanics work as i belive they were intended too, its a good time killer
