# Game concept testing

## skills a tester should have

* the ability to work with other and comunicate (if you are by your self the job would take 9000 years)

* patience becuse you could be trying to figure out the same problem for hours on end

## hardest part of being a tester

* trying to solve one problem without creating 20 more

* not screaming your head off when u see some one stuck in a part of the game (how you get stuck in the toturial of halo one is beyond me must have been one janky early build)

## something new learned / interesting

* looks ineteresting how they bring in the general public to get cracks at the early buids of game for feedback
