# Final Thoughts
you can glich out the spell bar by going into your inventory mid casting causing the cancle spell button that overlaps the spell bar
too not disapear not letting u see your spells,(you can still use the spells if u mouse over them and useing one once seems to fix it)

music is alright but pretty repetitive(one 1min song on an infanite loop)

a large amount of class and race options

no character customization

happy to play a game that has a necromancer class thats actually a necromancer(alot of games like to just make the necromancer a mage with evil sounding spells instead of being able to summon hordes of undead)

no idea what the manapearls would be used for(guess would have to get deeper in the game to find out?)
