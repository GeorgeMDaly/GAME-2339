## Details

* Game Title: Rune Factory 4
* Type : Farming/RPG
* platforms : 3DS


## Summary

rune factory 4 is a fantasy spin off of the Harvest moon siries. it combines the usual harvest moon farming with RPG and dungeon exploration mechanics. this particular rune factory has a soil quality mechanic where the conditions of the soil will affect crop growth so utalizeing fertalizers and crop rotations is nessisary if you want to maximize your crop yeilds. dungeons are also preset in this game they are pretty strait forward just keep cutting down enemies till you reach the boss the punch iot till it dies( fun fact you dont actually kill mosters in rune factory games all weapons and tools (wich can double as weapons) are enchanted via magic to just send mosters back to a place called the 1st forest when u wack'em hard enogh so no mosters are harmed in the makeing of your video game). monster in runefactory can also be tamed ( *Gotta catch' em all!* ) so that they can be used to help out on your farm, produce items, or be used as compaions for battle ( *i choose you strange apple thing with a face that shoots fireballs!* ) or mounts. romance is also a feture of harvest moon and rune factory alike and since you can select youre gender at the start of the game ( *revolutionary when it comes to harvet moon games and thier spin offs* ) you have a wide option of potential partners ( *just keep throwing turnips at a girl till she agrees to marry you NO I AM NOT JOKEING IT WORKS(especialy in 1st rune factory for one crazy NPC* )). the story is also alright you play the game as some one who lost thier memory( *kuz no video game has ever done this at the start before* ) via falling off an air ship ( *ok that bit is somewhat new* ) and is mistaken for the prince/princess that was assigend to the village ( *why royaltiy is in charge of a village i know not* ) and is then put in charge ( *and things get complicated from there* ).

## Final Thoughts
* compared to other rune factory gomes ive played the dungeons are much smaller

* compared to other run facoty games ive played the energy(RP) comsumtion of tools and weapons in this game is much smaller (wich lead me to jumping the gun on dungeon diveing in this game since i didnt want to waste the extra energy i had).

* the game actually had a line of dialouge for me completeing the 1st dungeon before the story told me to go there (i was chewed out for being reckless).

* sad the developers whent bankrupt before they could make a 5 (still hope since Marvoulus owns the game).
