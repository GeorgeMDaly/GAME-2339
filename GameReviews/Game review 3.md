* Game Title: Metal Gear Solid 5
* Type : action steath
* platforms : PC, PS4


# Summary
MGS5 is a tactical action steath game wich stood out at the time since the only options for a steath game were

* Murder Steath: every assasins creed game, dishonored (if you dont mind a bad ending)

basicly you just steath killed everything you saw, moved, or didnt like and even if the enemy was on to you it was ethier an insta fail for the given mission or not a big deal and u just added the enemy to the ever growing corpse pile and moved on(some cases you use said corpse pile to lure enemys to a bush kill them then rinse and repeat).

* pasafist/COWARD/Pure steath (no one has a rigid name for this type)

in this type of steath game you ABSOLUTLY can not be spoted and if you are the only option are to either run very fast and hide or Die.

now in MGS5 you have a VERY large amount of freedom in how you go about the mission be it sneaking or just going guns a blazeing but both methods and every thing inbetween require you to be smart. steath is one of your best tool in this game but even if you do get spoted if your able to adapt to the situation and are prepared then its still not the end of the world. now while in this game you are a super soldier bass ass you ARE still HUMAN and bullets tend to kill those so when the alarms go off the enemy wont just stand around they will call in back up, try to flank you out of cover, and bombard the aread with mortars(if they have em), and if they lose trak of you the AI will start lokking in the last place you were. and you cant just use the old murder steath tactic of just kill everything on the way in becuse IF an enemy finds a body they will alert the base and all units in the zone will go on alert and be very cautious so bodys need to be hiden properly. and on this point unlike games like dishonored in witch your are penaliozed heavaily for useing leathal means and tools (literaly u cant use 75% of the stuff you get if you want the good ending and avoiding the upscale in dificulty) you only recive a small score penalty for killing people and certian powerful items will limit your mission rank to only go as high as A Rank (and A ranks arent even ez in the 1st place). also if you use nonleathal means the enemy will eventually wake up and then imidiatly alert command so once you knock out that 1st enemy you put youre self on a clock. so witch ever way you choose to play the game offer a large array of weapons, gear, and companions, from non lethal bean bag shotguns to guided anti-tank missile(witch are EXTREAMLY lethal) you have options to choose from and by useing the supply drop command you can change equipment on the fly in the feild (you can even if you time it right knock some one out by haveing the supply drop fall on thier head the game is just riddled with easter eggs and secrets).

# Final Thoughts
* this game does have a multiplayer mode both direct PVP and indirect player base assults but the PVP mode (metal gear online) is basicly dead and the only people are are the crazy ones who never stoped playing since launch so dont expect a fair fight
* this is not an easy game it has quite the learning curve
* the AI is nither stupid nor blind thier line of sight is practly realaistic compared to most games, and if you take out a soldier while he is still on the radio command will notice and put out an alert and if you take him out after he calls in a disturbance but BEFORE he give the all clear check command will put out an alert and send people to investigate what happend to that soldier
* the AI learns youre play style and tries to adapt, if you take people out with head shots they will get helmets that protect them, if you go guns a blazeing and turn everyone into a beehive they will get body armor, and if you infiltrate frequently at night the soldiers will carry flashlights.
* there are a ton of secret methods the game doesnt tell you that you are expect to try and find out for your self (like if you use the empty magazine item thats normaly to create noise and hit some one in the head with it youll knock them out).
* take a shower regulary the enemy can smell you if you stink bad enogh (no i am not jokeing its an actual mechanic).
